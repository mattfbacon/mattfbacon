### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [sneturfahi](https://github.com/mattfbacon/sneturfahi).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning chess.
- 📚 I’m studying Japanese (not much recently), German (fairly consistently), Spanish (fluent/near-fluent, maintaining), and Lojban (fervently). .i xu do se jbobau .i iu ko co'a irci la'o ibu #lojban ibu la liberas .a [la diskord](https://discord.gg/BVm4EYR)
- 💬 Ask me about Linux, Rust, and the value of always learning new things.
- ️🌈 My <https://pronoun.is/he> but `they/them` is often simpler and easier.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Microsoft Azure runs on Linux

### Quick Developer Questions:

- Spaces or tabs: tabs, with a width of 2
- Light or dark mode: light (using [my custom theme](https://github.com/mattfbacon/vscode-theme), a derivative of Noctis)
- Preferred editor: NVim on the terminal, VSCodium (with embedded Neovim extension!) on X11/Wayland
- OSS License: AGPL 3.0 or later (even for non-network-based projects, because why not)
- Development OS: Arch Linux, with i3 or sway (tiling window managers rock!)
- Keyboard Layout: Dvorak ([save your hands](http://dvorak-keyboards.com/)), MessagEase ([actually designed for a phone](http://www.exideas.com/ME/me_faq.html))
- Shell: `fish`, then `bash`, then `zsh` (don't even talk to me about Nu)
- Okay, but if you had to choose, would you run MacOS or Windows? Windows, simply for its larger marketshare. I expect I would spend most of my time inside WSL...
