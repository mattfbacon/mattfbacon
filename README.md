### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Goldberg Variations on piano. , and stenotype
- 📚 I’m studying Japanese (not much recently), German (fairly consistently), Spanish (fluent/near-fluent, maintaining), and Lojban (fervently). .i xu do se jbobau .i iu ko co'a irci la'o ibu #lojban ibu la liberas
- 💬 Ask me about Linux, Rust, and the value of always learning new things.
- ️🌈 My pronouns are `he/him` but `they/them` is often simpler and easier.

### Quick Developer Questions:

- Spaces or tabs: tabs, with a width of 2
- Light or dark mode: light (using [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) until I get around to making my own theme)
- Preferred editor: NVim
- OSS License: AGPL 3.0 or later (even for non-network-based projects, because why not), sometimes CC0/0BSD for small stuff
- Development OS: Arch Linux, with sway (tiling window managers rock!)
- Keyboard Layout: Dvorak ([save your hands](http://dvorak-keyboards.com/)), MessagEase ([actually designed for a phone](http://www.exideas.com/ME/me_faq.html), [my implementation](https://github.com/mattfbacon/messagease-better)), learning stenotype ([my impl](https://github.com/mattfbacon/sordahe))
- Shell: `fish`, then `bash`, then `zsh` (don't even talk to me about Nu)
- Okay, but if you had to choose, would you run MacOS or Windows? Windows, simply for its larger marketshare. I expect I would spend most of my time inside WSL...
