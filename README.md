### Quick Developer Questions:

- Spaces or tabs: tabs, with a width of 2
- Light or dark mode: light (using my custom theme, a derivative of Noctis)
- Preferred editor: NVim on the terminal, VS Code (with embedded Neovim extension!) on X11
- Development OS: Arch Linux, with i3 window manager on X11 (tiling window managers rock!)
- Shell: `fish`, then `bash`, then `zsh`
- Okay, but if you had to choose, would you run MacOS or Windows? Windows, simply for its larger marketshare.
